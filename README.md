# Uncommon Python Error: ZeroDivisionError
This repository demonstrates and fixes an uncommon error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError.  The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero.

The `bug.py` file contains code that produces the error.  `bugSolution.py` shows how to gracefully handle such cases.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Python, especially when working with user inputs or data that may not always be valid.
